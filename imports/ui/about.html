  <h2>Why Workshop Share?</h2>
  <p> Born at Hack@Brown 2017, Workshop Share is a database to share workshop presentations and resources.
    Created to mediate the problem of single-use intensive workshops, the goal of this website is to allow
  the creators of workshops to share their PowerPoints, Handouts, Scripts, and other workshop materials
for others who want reference to teach similar topics. In an aim to minimize the work that is inevitably
done over and over again, and the disappearance of resources from the archive once they are used once, Workshop Share
is a tool for knowledge sharing and miximizing resource usage.</p>

  <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
  <p> Students at Brown and RISD, we are coders, graphic designers, activists, and mentors
    who are committed to seeing a more useful archive of Workshops which honor the original creators
    in their ability to produce and facilitate important content to expand the minds of their audience. We
    believe that others, like us, both have a desire to share and see their resources re-used, and are seeking
    existing materials to reuse for varying audiences.</p>
